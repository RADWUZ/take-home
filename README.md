Project Overview
This project integrates Magic Link Authentication and Google OAuth for user login and metadata retrieval. The application successfully implements email-based OTP login and displays user metadata. However, there is an issue with the Google OAuth integration.

Known Issue: Google OAuth
While Google OAuth sign-in is initiated successfully, the process encounters an error during metadata retrieval. When trying to login I'd get:

"Could not process OAuth request because cookies are malformed, missing, or tampered with."

Problem:
Google Auth process allows the user to sign in, but does not return user metadata (email, public address, etc.), causing the process to fail when trying to display this information in the dashboard.

Troubleshooting Attempts:
Ensured correct API keys and environment variables:

Verified the correct REACT_APP_MAGIC_API_KEY, REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, and REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET.
These were added to the .env file and verified in the Magic and Google developer consoles.

Updated Redirect URIs:

Ensured the Redirect URI used in Google OAuth (https://auth.magic.link/...) was correctly configured.
Adjusted the redirect URI to use window.location.origin to see if the OAuth flow would work.

Relaxed Content Security Policy (CSP):

Attempted to modify the Content Security Policy to relax restrictions around unsafe-eval to check if it would resolve cookie or script execution issues during OAuth.
Checked Google API scopes:

Verified that the necessary scopes (openid, email, profile) were included in the OAuth request to allow for retrieving user data from Google.
Tested OAuth Flow:

Added debugging logs to inspect the OAuth flow in both Login.js and Dashboard.js. Confirmed the issue is with metadata retrieval post-sign-in.
Cross-Origin Issues:

Investigated cross-origin cookie-related issues. Despite ensuring that cookies are set and valid, the error persists.
Next Steps (if more time was available):
Use a proxy or backend for OAuth:

Instead of handling the OAuth flow entirely on the frontend, we would implement a backend to manage Google OAuth tokens securely, which might help in avoiding cookie issues.

Additional debugging with Magic support:

Reaching out to Magic's support team for insights on cookie handling issues in OAuth could help resolve the issue faster.
Update Security Policies:

Refine or further relax security policies temporarily to isolate whether CSP configurations are the root cause of the cookie issue.
Current Status:
The application works flawlessly with email OTP login, but Google OAuth is currently unable to retrieve and display user information.
